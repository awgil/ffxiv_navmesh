            The xz-plane cell size to use for fields. [Limit: > 0] [Units: world]

            The voxelization cell size #cs defines the voxel size along both axes of
            the ground plane: x and z in Recast. This value is usually derived from the
            character radius `r`. A recommended starting value for #cs is either `r/2`
            or `r/3`. Smaller values of #cs will increase rasterization resolution and
            navmesh detail, but total generation time will increase exponentially.  In
            outdoor environments, `r/2` is often good enough.  For indoor scenes with
            tight spaces you might want the extra precision, so a value of `r/3` or
            smaller may give better results.

            The initial instinct is to reduce this value to something very close to zero
            to maximize the detail of the generated navmesh. This quickly becomes a case
            of diminishing returns, however. Beyond a certain point there's usually not
            much perceptable difference in the generated navmesh, but huge increases in
            generation time.  This hinders your ability to quickly iterate on level
            designs and provides little benefit.  The general recommendation here is to
            use as large a value for #cs as you can get away with.

            #cs and #ch define voxel/grid/cell size.  So their values have significant
            side effects on all parameters defined in voxel units.

            The minimum value for this parameter depends on the platform's floating point
            accuracy, with the practical minimum usually around 0.05.

            The voxelization cell height #ch is defined separately in order to allow for
            greater precision in height tests. A good starting point for #ch is half the
            #cs value. Smaller #ch values ensure that the navmesh properly connects areas
            that are only separated by a small curb or ditch.  If small holes are generated
            in your navmesh around where there are discontinuities in height (for example,
            stairs or curbs), you may want to decrease the cell height value to increase
            the vertical rasterization precision of Recast.

            The parameter #walkableRadius defines the worldspace agent radius `r` in voxels.
            Most often, this value of #walkableRadius should be calculated as `ceil(r / cs)`.
            Note this is based on #cs since the agent radius is always parallel to the ground
            plane.

            If the #walkableRadius value is greater than zero, the edges of the navmesh will
            be pushed away from all obstacles by this amount.

            A non-zero #walkableRadius allows for much simpler runtime navmesh collision checks.
            The game only needs to check that the center point of the agent is contained within
            a navmesh polygon.  Without this erosion, runtime navigation checks need to collide
            the geometric projection of the agent's logical cylinder onto the navmesh with the
            boundary edges of the navmesh polygons.

            In general, this is the closest any part of the final mesh should get to an
            obstruction in the source geometry.  It is usually set to the maximum
            agent radius.

            If you want to have tight-fitting navmesh, or want to reuse the same navmesh for
            multiple agents with differing radii, you can use a `walkableRadius` value of zero.
            Be advised though that you will need to perform your own collisions with the navmesh
            edges, and odd edge cases issues in the mesh generation can potentially occur.  For
            these reasons, specifying a radius of zero is allowed but is not recommended.

            the agent can walk up. Given a designer-defined `maxClimb` distance in world
